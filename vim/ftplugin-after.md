# Commands for File Type

You can create a file in `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/<language>.vim` and add commands there to execute when loading a specific language. Instead of using `:set`, use `:setlocal`

Tip comes from [this SOF question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/158968/changing-vim-indentation-behavior-by-file-type).
