In vim can temporarily search in case-insensitive manner by adding '\c' to search string. Can globally allow with `set ignorecase`, and make the search smarter with `set smartcase` which only searches in a case-insensitive manner when all lowercase, and case-sensitive when includes uppercase chars. '\C' to force case-sensitive search.
