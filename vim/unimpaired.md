# vim-unimpaired

tpope's vim-unimpaired is exceptionally powerful.

My first use-case was just using `[b` and `]b` to switch buffers.

However it also is also pre-configured to toggle a few common options:

- `[oh` and `]oh` to toggle `hlsearch`
- `[ol` and `]ol` to toggle `list`
- `[on` and `]on` to toggle `number`
- `[os` and `]os` to toggle `spell`

In addition, it has a plurb about `paste`:
Press `yo` or `yO` to use `o` and `O` respectively with `paste` automatically turned on, and `paste` will be turned off after leaving insert mode
